# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The creation of this project was to make an application that can easily access the current weather information, humidity, and wind speed and also for the next 5 days. This application can help anyone with planning a trip or even to just search up the current weather in any city.

OpenWeather Map Server-Side API was used to access weather data. This project taught me how to make API requests using a fetch and adding functionality based on user requests.

## Installation
